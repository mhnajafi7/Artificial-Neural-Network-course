# Neural Network Assignment 1 - Spring 2024

## Table of Contents
1. Prerequisites
2. Binary encoding
3. Bipolar encoding
4. Noisy patterns (10%)
5. Noisy patterns (25%)

## Prerequisites
This section outlines the necessary prerequisites and dependencies required to run the notebook. Make sure to install all the listed packages before proceeding.

## Binary encoding
In this section, binary encoding techniques are discussed and implemented

## Bipolar encoding
This section covers bipolar encoding, an alternative to binary encoding that can be more efficient for certain neural network applications. The implementation details and examples are provided.

## Noisy patterns (10%)
Here, the impact of 10% noise on pattern recognition is examined. The section includes experiments and analysis to understand how neural networks handle noisy input data.

## Noisy patterns (25%)
Similar to the previous section, this part investigates the effects of 25% noise on patterns.
